#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)    
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)   
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers customer ON feb.orderID = customer.order_id
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price <> 'Price Each'
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, 
COUNT(Product) as amountOfProduct, 
ROUND(SUM(Quantity)  * price, 2) as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales jan
WHERE Product <> ''
AND Product <> 'Product'
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Revenue desc;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, 
Quantity,
ROUND(SUM(Quantity) * price) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
